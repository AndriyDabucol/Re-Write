# Re:Write

Re:Write is a webapp that merges note-taking with active recall. It can be used interchangably, for either note-taking or it's unique "Re:Write" function!

This "Re:Write" function lets you re:write your note from scratch, forcing you to actively recall the information in your prior note.

### How to use

1. Create a brand new note
2. Click on the note.
3. Click on the "Re:Write" button
3: Wait for the timer to tick down. This will ensure that you will have to force your brain to recall the prior notes.
4. Click the note again.
5. Try and recreate the first note as close as possible.

You may peek or look at your previous note with the "View Previous" button. But it's highly encouraged to only use this button if you're really stuck or if you've completed and want to check how close you got.
